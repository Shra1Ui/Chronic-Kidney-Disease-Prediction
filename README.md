# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Prediction
In this project, I developed a machine learning system to predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using patient health data. I handled real medical datasets, performed data cleaning and exploratory analysis, and trained multiple models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM)
